            <p>I notice occassionally that I get a few repeat questions in the chat box, so I wanted to make a little page to help out with a few of them. Let me know if there is something else you want answered here!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: how did you make this site/webmastery tips?</p>
            <p>A: brackets, internet searching, and perfectionism. i HIGHLY recommend using an editor with a live preview function, rather than the native neocities code editor (this is my number one tip). i want to put out a video on my process, so i'll link that here (if i ever do it. sorry)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: could i have the code for ____?</p>
            <p>A: yes! i don't care if people steal my code, that's how coding is learned. all of this website is frankensteined from online tutorials so it'd be stupid to gatekeep it or whatever. feel free to dig around with the inspect tool- specific components (for example, the music player) have mini tutorials in the library (on the left navbar, click the library, then click the floppy disks).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: where did you go/will you come back?</p>
            <p>A: i have depression and am working on a chemistry degree üëç. i also have a hard time coming up with ideas for the site these days. if i am missing for long periods of time that is why! im finally getting treatment so hopefully you will be seeing more regular updates in the future. thank you for caring about me i love you :-)</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: why isn't this page bedazzled?</p>
            <p>A: ILL DO IT LATER I PROMMY I JUST WANT TO PUT UP THE UPDATE LEA ME ALONE</p>
