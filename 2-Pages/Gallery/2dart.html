Her labcoat is tied around her waist and he has several small colorful bands on each of his fingers. Sparkplug is a small brown cube with a blue tongue shaped like a rubber sticky hand. They have no eyes, so most of their body is their mouth. There is an image in the top left of Zap talking to someone out-of-picture, while Sparkplug is nestled happily into their braid. The text next to Zap has his name in colorful block letters, and reads 'He/she/they, 32 y/o, 5 foot 9 inches' and has small hand-drawn graphics of the genderfluid and lesbian flags. The text next to Sparkplug has their name in block letters similarly, and reads 'He/they/box, 7-8 y/o, 0 foot 5 inches' with the nonbinary flag in the same style.">
